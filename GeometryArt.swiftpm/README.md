# ParametricArt

## Description

ParametricArt is a project that aims to present generative art, more specifically, algorithmic art, using concepts of parametric equations. Interaction with the user occurs, firstly, through the explanation of parametric equations. The user can then interact with 4 examples of curves resulting from different equations, generating very interesting animations. Ideally, the user, through various interactions, has an increased interest in the areas of mathematics and the possibilities that such knowledge results in.
